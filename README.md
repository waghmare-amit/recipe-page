## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

This is the first project of my life. I have learnt to use the theoretical knowledge practically, particularly talking - There's a thing called 'container' for each content. We create a container and then enter the content into it, the reason of creating a container is to manipulate the content according to our need, and to only manipulate the certain part of the viewport (i.e. The Container), and not the whole viewport.

### Continued development

I am currently in the memorizing phase (not the typical memorizing technique, but the creating a muscle memory). I am not totally aware about most of the CSS properties like 'display' (and some properties related to it), difference between 'align-item' and 'justify-content'.
